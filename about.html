      <h2>1986</h2> 
      The Okan Foundation for Culture, Education, and Sports was established in 1986 with the objective of conducting research and studies in the social, cultural, and economic fields, focusing on issues related to sports, health, and education. The foundation aims to prepare proposals for the resolution of these issues, offering suggestions for solutions within the integrity of the country, and assisting the government in their implementation.

      In the academic year 2003-2004, Istanbul Okan University commenced its educational activities. During this period, the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and Faculty of Engineering and Architecture were established. Additionally, the Institutes of Social Sciences and Natural Sciences were founded within the same academic year.

In the inaugural year, the university achieved notable success, with students entering its programs ranking among the top 1100 candidates. Istanbul Okan University secured a position among the top 7 foundation universities.

Identifying itself with the slogan "The University Closest to Business Life" since its establishment, Istanbul Okan University has provided students with numerous internship opportunities and has engaged in collaborative projects with industry partners such as Türk Telekom A.Ş. and DEİK (Foreign Economic Relations Board).

      <h2>2007</h2> 
      Operating under the slogan "The University Closest to Business Life," Istanbul Okan University graduated its first class in the 2006-2007 academic year. With its expert academic staff and a contemporary approach to education, the university has been preparing its students for professional life from the very beginning, integrating theory and practice through practical-oriented studies.

Aiming to build a bridge between education and the business world, Istanbul Okan University facilitates its students' involvement in businesses as part of the Business Life Preparation Program starting from the first year. This allows students to familiarize themselves with the professional environment, establish a connection between theory and practice, and enhance their knowledge, skills, and motivation. Students who successfully complete the Business Life Preparation Program receive a participation certificate, and upon graduation, certificates related to work experience are added to their diplomas.

In the 2008-2009 academic year, the Law Faculty and Vocational School started education with a total of 29 departments in both regular and evening classes.

Our university has adopted a unique structure by implementing a shared program that is only available in three universities. This allows students to save time when choosing their desired departments.
